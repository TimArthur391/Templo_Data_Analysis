# Templo_Data_Analysis
Analyse the data exported from templo and output useful quantitative information, as part of a departmental project to investigate:
 (A) can data be reliably extracted from TEMPLOÂ®, CONTEMPLAS, 
 (B) can external joint moments be calculated from this data, 
 (C) do the conclusions made via qualitative interpretation of the video and force vector agree with conclusions made with the addition of the external joint moment data, and 
 (D) if the above are true, can we utilise this during clinical appointments, as well as retrospective and prospective research
 
I used this project as an excuse to investigate and learn Jupyter notebooks, and the python libraries of Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
To aid in the learning process I completed the www.freecodecamp.org course 'Data Analysis with Python'
